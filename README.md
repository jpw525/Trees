# Trees

This is example code from when I was learning random forest.

Using the Boston dataset this creates training and testing samples, runs, plots and cross-validates a regression tree, prunes the tree, predicts, plots, and outputes MSE for the regression tree.
It also runs a random forest with boosting.

Open in R.
